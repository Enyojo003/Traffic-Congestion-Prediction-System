# Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-System
The Traffic Congestion Prediction System is designed to provide accurate and actionable predictions of traffic congestion based on historical data. This system allows user to input the hour of the day and the day of the week to receive a prediction of traffic congestion. It aims to assist in traffic management by predicting congestion levels.

This project predicts traffic congestion levels using data analysis and visualization techniques. It includes Python scripts, HTML maps, datasets, and documentation to support traffic monitoring and forecasting.
